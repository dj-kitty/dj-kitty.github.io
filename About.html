		<p>My name is David. My birthday is January 22. Find me if you want the year, but if you can find me, you could've just found the year. I have a cat, the fourth of third I've had in I-don't-know-how-many-years. Her name is Nala. I am homeschooled, but go to an online school called Braintree Academy.</p>
		<p>My family lives out in the country. We currently have two goats, fifteen or so chickens, five dogs, and three other cats. </p>
		<p>I swim on the local highschool swim team in Jerome. The event I am best at is the 500 freestyle. I almost made it to state last semester. I am on a local Boy Scout troop, which I have been a part of for almost 3 years now. My favorite activites to do are read and watch minecraft videos.</p>
